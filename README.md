## My process

1. Firstly, I drew out a mockup for how I wanted the site to look.
2. I then went and learned a bit more about react for the purposes of making the project properly.
3. After this, I went and made my header and got the nav functionality working.
4. Then finally I wrote out all of my info in every other page, linked my projects, and worked on deploying the project.

### Built with

- React
- Tailwind

### What I learned

- I learned a lot about React functionality and how state works

### Continued development

- Flesh out the projects page and create new, more polished projects for the page.
- Possibly create a backend for the contacts page so that people can submit their info to me for me to reach out to them.

### Useful resources

- The TailwindCSS docs were very easy to navigate and use
